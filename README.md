## What it does
Upon making a keyword search for a Youtube video, the application scrapes data for the top videos and the comment section as well. Using natural language processing, we are able to rank the videos based on what people wrote in the comments section. Our algorithm ensures that videos of higher scores were understood by more people, had concepts explained correctly, and were popular on the platform.

## How we built it
The applications involves the usage of Django Framework, Youtube API, Bert-Embeddings, and Spacy. The Django Framework is used to enter the search terms while the Youtube API is used to get Youtube data for processing. We used Bert models to figure out which comments were associated with the user being able to understand/not understand the concept and developed a scoring system. By scoring a video based on the nature of the comments, likes, dislikes, and views, we created a rank list which is in the order of easiest comprehension, correctness of conceptual knowledge, and production value.

## Technologies Used
