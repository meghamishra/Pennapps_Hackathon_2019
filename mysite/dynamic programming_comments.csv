8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"Also, in the bottom up approach in github code, the line `K[i][j] = Math.max(K[i-1][j], K[i-1][j-wt[i-1]] + val[i-1]);` is incorrect. It should be `K[i][j] = Math.max(K[i-1][j], K[i-1][j-wt[i-1]] + val[i]);`",0

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,Thanks ! The Best explanation!!! Keep up the good work!,0
8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,This is bottom-up solution. It would be better if you go through Recursion -> Memoize -> Bottom-up approaches.,1
8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"The first row is not exactly total weight rather it is knapsack size, so if knapsack size is zero we cannot contain any item. If it is one I can have first item, if knapsack size is 3 I can have either first or second item and so on. Also I believe we should first consider what is changing if thief puts item in knapsack e.g. weight will change and capacity of bag will reduce, value will increase and capacity will reduce and so on. Considering all these variables we need to try to reduce the recurrence on our own. IMO that would have been better.

Also at 15:19 j should have been replaced with w where i (0,1,...i-1) are the items we can pick and w is the weight knapsack can carry.",0

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,best platform for easy understanding....,0
8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"@tushar  Why do we need to run two loops with W and number of items? If the total W is 1000000 and number of items is 3. This loop will still run for 1000001*3 times. In the given example in the video there will be 8*4 = 32 number of calculation. Although it can be done using only 6 number of calculation. I have executed my code with various example and it runs correctly on all the cases.
Although it takes same space complexity i.e., W*n but we don't have to fill the entire 2D matrix. Please correct if I am wrong.",0

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"Great one.
It would have been still better if he had written 
MAX (
1) currentItem's value + T[one_row_up=0][3-3=remaining weight's index] which gives the maximum value for remaining available weight considering all the previous lesser weighted items 
OR
2) T[one_row_up][same_column] which gives the value considering all the previous lesser weighted items
) .
If 2) is chosen, then it means the current item is not chosen for the weight considered at the moment.

Of course T[0][0] triggered the thinking process immediately! Just watch 3 or 4 times until you understand and dwell on the logic in your mind to satisfy your intuition completely and for retaining the reasoning why this logic works.",1

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"For people who are asking about intuition and to explain why does he go up and left. This is what is the crux of DP. It's called memoization. For example, let's see the point where you have 1,3  and 4 weights and w=7 at 8:49. Now  you have two choices:

1. Use 4 
If you use 4, then you are left with 7-4=3 total knapsack size and 1 and 3 as remaining weights available to you. Now the question can be rephrased as ""you have a knapsack of size 3 and 1, 3 wights, available, give me the optimal total value"". This is where memoization comes into picture, you have already solved this subproblem and you already have an optimal solution for it i.e optimal value = 4. That is what basically he is doing by going up and left at t[1][3]

2. Do no use 4
Again question becomes, you have a total knapsack of size 7 and two wegiths of size 1 and 3, give optimal value. We have already solved this sub problem as well. It's 5 (t[1][7])",0

However, I feel it would be good if you could have demonstrated in your videos, that how we came up to the tabular solution(Bottom up) approach for this problem in  the beginning. 

Basically, the formula explained in the last part of the video explains why we need a 2D matrix(simply because, at any point, the profit P(i,w) is a function of two variables which lead to solution in a bottom up approach via tabulation). Please let me know your opinion. Thanks.",0

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,Thank you! Now i figured it out :),0
8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"Thanks Tushar. 

The traditional way a DP problem is worked upon is
1. Recursive Optimal Sub Structure definition
2. Noticing that the optimal solution for the new incremental input addition is purely dependent on sub problems solved for earlier (memorisation)
3. Then converting the problem solution to an if-then statement in one or more loops nested.

The hardest part is point 3. You have explained the loop, matrix representation and the if-then part beautifully. It will be great if you can generically touch on points 1 & 2 and the part of 3 where you ""notice"" that this problem has been solved for before.

Lastly, backtracking a filled matrix to find the items in case of 0/1 Knapsack or the LCS is great for explanation sake but it would be great if you called out that this identification of what item to include could also be done while filling the matrix where by some items will be added or dropped(in the case of 0/1 knapsack) to show the journey of the optimal solution.

Great job. Even after 20 years of experience, when I go for interviews, some idiots are stuck on DP. That said learning DP is really fun.",0

I have just one suggestion ,you should have 0th column also so that you have its row(top row) with all 0s.I got little bit lost :) with your explanation when you said for the first column with weight 1 that best we can do is 1 (for weight 0 to 7). If you had the top row (with 0s) you could have applied the max formula and shown everyone why each value ended up being 1 (like you did with other three items). The reason I mentioned this is because while writing a computer program we need the top row with 0s in order to make the max formula work for 1st item.

But again thanks a lot.. :)",8

I was referring to your Minimum Number of Coins video and its solution at your github rep (CoinChangingMinimumCoin.java) where you solved the problem in O(n) space. Since the idea behind the problems in similar (find the max value v/s min coins) is it possible to similarly do the Knapsack problem in O(n) space as well? If there is one, does it change the running time?",0

8LusJS5-AGo,0/1 Knapsack Problem Dynamic Programming,"Hey Tushar , Many many thanks for doing such a wonderful job of explanining dynamic programming problems in such a lucid way!!. Kudos to you. However in your videos I find one little thing missing and thats is how you arrive at the optimal substructure property of a given example ( which IMO is the crux for nailing down new dyn problems). Like you directly start solving the probem by drawing a 2D /1D array, process of filling the array and then writing down the recurrence at the very end. It would be really helpful if you could spend time in discussing the thorught process to approach the problem first which will really help listeners to develop a knack of solving new dyn problems. As a very specific example , in this video  , before even we start to solve the knapsack problem, discussing the optimal substructure property linguistically  like :

The maximum value that can be obtained from n items is max of following two values.
1) Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item).
2) Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W minus weight of the nth item (including nth item).
If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot be included and case 1 is the only possibility.

would have been really useful.

Thanks again for such a wonderful job!!",87

OQ5jsbhAv_M,"19. Dynamic Programming I: Fibonacci, Shortest Paths","K, so here is one question/concept that seems to arise from this lecture. If you can traverse an expansive abstract DAG from the bottom up (base case/root to solution), then you have a nice linear solution without memoization that you probably never really needed dynamic programming for. If you can't, you try to recurse backwards to create a similar linearity. Recursing backwards while memoizing repeated computations in a hypothetical call tree, i.e. utilizing optimal substructure to create this effective linearity while consuming linear memory.
My question would be: is there a notion of forward, reverse or both optimal substructure? Let's say a sorted list would seem to have both. You can easily follow it from either end to the other. This is a hard concept to express as a question. But if the best solution can be found from guessing from the first node forward or from the last node backwards, what makes one more efficient than the other?",0

Now he redefined the the problem by giving the ""k"" parameter to solve the cyclic problem, which gave him #subproblems = O(|V|.|V|), one for k and other for v.

Recursion is conceptually elegant, but inefficient if for no other reason that it requires the overhead of a function call to do what could be done in a simple loop using local variables. The ""memoization"" idea seems to involve creating a global variable as a way of sneaking local variables past the thought police. 

When it comes down to it, everything boils down to machine code, and the most efficient algorithm is the one that requires the fewest instruction cycles. We weren't necessarily worse programmers than the computer scientists, but we had to contend with real-world limitations. Primitive equipment required primitive methods. 

The first computer I worked with had 4000 6-bit characters of core storage (aka RAM), instruction timings in milliseconds, and no OS. A good programmer was one who could squeeze every ounce of performance out of that beast, and since the biggest program you could write wasn't much more than 1000 lines, if that, you didn't have to worry about spaghettification, memory management and all the rest of it.

- 벨만 포드 알고리즘 만든 벨만이 다이나믹 프로그래밍이라는 이름을 창시했다. 벨만이 다이나믹 프로그래밍이라고 이름 지은 이유는 별 뜻 없고 '그냥 멋있어 보여서'다.

- 하나의 문제를 완전탐색으로 재귀적으로 풀 때 그 문제의 부분문제(Subproblems)의 답을 재활용하는 기법이 메모아이제이션(Memoization)이다. 재귀로 문제를 풀면 exponential 시간이 소요되는데, 한 번 풀었던 문제의 답을 메모로 적어 놓고 다시 필요할 때 반환함으로써 그 문제 풀이는 O(1) 시간밖에 걸리지 않는다.

- DP에는 재귀적인 구현인 하향식 접근(Top-down approach) 외에도 반복문을 이용한 상향식 접근(Bottom-up approach) 방법이 있다. 상향식은 함수 호출을 적게 하니까 스택을 적게 먹는 장점이 있겠지.

- 시간복잡도: 부분 문제의 갯수 * 부분 문제를 푸는 데에 걸리는 시간(메모 해 놔서 재귀 안 걸리는 데는 O(1)임)

----------

31:00 이후 최단 경로 설명.

- 오랫동안 잊고 있었던 그래프 이론이 등장함.
/
- 정점(vertex, node), 간선(edge, link, line)
- 차수(degree): 어떤 정점의 간선의 수.
/
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): 비순환 유향(방향) 그래프
- 내차수(indegree): 방향 그래프에서 어떤 정점으로 들어오는 간선(incoming edge)의 수.
- 외차수(outdegree): 방향 그래프에서 어떤 정점에서 나가는 간선(outgoing edge)의 수. 
- 위상 정렬(Topological sorting): 선수과목 구조처럼 보이게 DAG을 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 한 방향으로 죽 늘어 놓는 것.

- 출발점에서 나가는 간선을 기준으로 부분문제를 만들 수도 있고 목적지로 들어오는 간선을 기준으로 부분문제를 만들 수도 있음

- 사이클이 있는 그래프에서 시간복잡도는 무한대임.
- DAG의 경우 시간복잡도: O(V+E)
- DP 쓰려면 부분 문제는 비순환이어야 한다.",0

OQ5jsbhAv_M,"19. Dynamic Programming I: Fibonacci, Shortest Paths","Some Micro-Improvements for Bottom Up that just popped into mind: 
* If we'd pass the fib[k-1] (as f_in_previous_iteration), 
* * then we wouldnt need to go and find it from far-away memory. Anyway memory access is more expensive than most think.
* * * includes removing the need to calc address &fibKm1 = &fib + k - 1;
* the check: if k <= 2: f=1;     can be moved out from the for-loop. IF statement is generally bad practice anyway (stops all blocks of CPU that depend on it)
* * have 2 functions, 1st does k==1 or ==2 and the rest and the rcursive part never checks it, just starts from 3
* range(1; n+1).   N+1 is constant and should be calculated once per fib() call
* * do you mean while k < n + 1? Or actually the last iteration would calc N+1 and give wrong answer?
* variable f is irrelevant - could just use f[k] everywhere
* For  f[k] actually &f + k    is done on CPU
* * pointer arithmetics would be faster as this instruction is not needed.

C++ proto-code for those 1st thoughts:

int  f[N] = {1, 1};    // fill first with 1st 2 numbers = 1
int* const fEnd = f+N;
int* f_m2 = f++;    // pointer to fib[k-2]
int* f_m1 = f++;   // pointer to fib[k-1]
while (++f < fEnd) {
     *f = *f_m1 + *f_m2; // use pointers to get & set
       f_m2++; f_m1++; // inc all 3 pointers
}
return *f;",0

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"Known:
N steps total. 
X is the number of 1-step, and Y is the number 2-steps. 
To Solve:
Now calculate that N can be a combination of how many Xs and how many Ys. 
Try X=0 and all else Y, if it works, record that; otherwise don't record that.
Try X=1 and all else Y, if it works, record that; otherwise don't record that.
Try X=2 ...
Now each record/combination looks like this: say N=6 steps, and one record/combination is X=4 (Four 1-step) and Y=1 (One 2-steps)
For each record/combination, the number of ways to arrange those Xs and Ys is (X+Y)! for all permutations
But for each record/combination, all Xs changing orders among themselves is considered 1 arrangement (for example: X1 X2 X3 X4 Y1 is the same as X2 X1 X3 X4 Y1) , and the same goes for Ys.
Therefore for each record/combination, the ways to arrange Xs and Ys is (X+Y)!/(X!Y!)
Now calculate (X+Y)!/(X!Y!) for all record/combination, and the sum is the output of the function.",0

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"General solution: need to determine number of 1 steps and 2 steps then permutate the orders while dividing by permutations of 1steps and 2steps.

Define:
1. Max number of 2-steps ""max2"" = floor(N/2)

2. Max number of 1steps ""max1"" = N.

3. Number of 1 steps possible ""1step"" = N - 2(max2)


Now determine equation for increasing numbers of 2steps (skip steps 4, 5 and 6 if you're comfortable with combinations amd permutations):

4. If 2steps is zero, 1step = N and number of ways ""NoW"" = 1.

5. If 2steps is 1, 1steps is N-2. Number of ways is a permutation of total 1steps and 2steps; thus N-2 but plus the number of 2steps which is 1 here. So:

NoW(for 2steps=1) =
  (N-1)!/(N-2)!1!

6. Similarly for 2steps of 2:
NoW = (N-2)!/(N-4)!2!

Especially writing solutions and functions you really want to connect the entire logic to something in the real world if possible.
A pure math problem is the kind of stuff that is very restricted in the people that will understand what it does, why its implemented that way and how to change it to some new changes in the core problem.


If you want to write a proper library of important business logic that somehow represents a universal problem, you better invest time and effort, which this problem represents ; but its also so disconnected from the vast majority of what a job of a programmer actually involves in everyday work ; as this is quite specific to someone that is especially trained and competent to write such libraries (for which you really want someone that is very capable in the math involved, which doesnt even need to be a programmer).

If you visit kth step there are numways(0,k)*numways(k,n) different paths and you dont visit kth step you must pass this node by step of (k-1,k+1). Thus you have numways(0,k-1)*numways(k+1,n) different ways. Thus the solution becomes numways(0,n)= numways(0,k-1)*numways(k+1,n) + numways(0,k)*numways(k,n).

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"EDIT: I just realized that a much easier way to solve this first problem would be to do the Fibonacci sequence to the Nth degree and I am so dumb. My solution still works tho, and hey at least I realized a connection between the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal's triangle.

No one is gonna see this, or care, but another way to solve the first problem (1 or 2 step case) would be to use pascal's triangle. If have an array with pascal's triangle left justified (with 0's in all of the blank spaces), then the loop to solve it is just 

int totalNum = 0, countUp = 0, countDown = N;
while(counter <= N){
    totalNum += pascal[countUp][countDown];
    countDown--;
    countUp++;
}
return totalNum;

This is a solution, because pascal's triangle can describe how many binary numbers can be created given an Nth bit binary number and K 1s. The Nth bit corresponds to the row of pascal's triangle, and the K corresponds to the Kth column of the triangle. You can describe the problem in a binary number system, with 1 meaning two steps, and 0 meaning 1 step. Since each time you add a 1, or a double step, the bits decrease by 1, you go up a row. Since the number of 1's goes up with each double step, you go over a column. So summing this will give you your answer. Sorry that I'm terrible at explaining things btw, this probably makes no sense

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"A math-oriented approach... maybe?

I didn't watch the video but noticed all the solutions are recursive. I approached the first problem he mentions (without the set of numbers), but to me it seems like potentially we could do this using a basic expression for combinations (more efficiently??). When you have x total choices that are true/false and y of them are true, then this is the number of combinations of which y choices are the true ones: x!/(y!(x-y)!). Then in our scenario the y variable varies depending on the number of steps we choose to take a single step, which also makes the total number of steps x we need to take vary. If we take all of this into consideration, couldn't we simply solve this problem using the below pseudo-code?

if n=0,1 set combos=1 quit
if n%2 != 0 set odd=1

for i=0+odd:2:n (meaning i=0,2,4,...n or 1,3,5,...n, where i represents the number of single steps)

If num_ways(0)==1 then it means that you include ""0"" step as choice, and it doesn't work anyway because it'd be infinite number of ways.

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"Very smart way of thinking about this problem, I just had a different thought about the num_ways(0) = 1 you presented. If that was the case, let's suppose I had to calculate the number of ways I could climb a 2 steps staircase. You'd argue that you could have [0,1,2] or [0,2], but I think that wouldn't be true. I could argue that I could go from 0 to 0, them from 0 to 1, them from 1 to 1, them from 1 to 2, them from 2 to 2. That would be: [0,0,1,1,2,2], because I could just stand in the same step (like going from 0 to 0) and that would be one valid ""step"". Therefore, I could have actually infinite possibilities, because [0,0,0,1,2], [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,2], [0,1,2,2,2,2,2] would also be valid ways, because I would be able to just stand in the same step how many times I wanted.

The problem states that you can go 1 or 2 steps. Standing in the same step is the same as going 0 steps, which is not in your set of valid steps. The same would apply if your set of valid steps was [1,3,5], you could move only 1, 3 or 5 steps per time, but not zero steps, and that's why I don't agree with your statement. My answer would be zero ways for a zero step staircase, because if I can only move 1 or 2 steps, there is no way to climb. The same would apply for a 3 steps staircase, when my set of valid steps was [4,5,6].

HOWEVER I do realize it was necessary to return 1 for n = 0 in order to make the recursion work, otherwise num_ways(2) would return 1 instead of 2.",0

5o-kdjv7FD0,Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem,"It looks like you found the correct pattern, but did you prove it other than recognizing it and trying for a few cases? I'm not sure what is customary in coding interviews: is it sufficient to merely give a solution, or do you have to explain exactly why that solution is correct?

Anyway, thanks for the interesting problem! Here's my solution (in Rust) to the general problem which I believe is easier to prove why it works. (`usize` is an unsigned integer, `&[usize]` is a slice/array view of some unsigned integers, `|params| { expression… }` is a lambda.)

fn num_ways(n: usize, step_sizes: &[usize]) -> usize {
    step_sizes.iter().map(|&step_size| {
        if step_size == n {
            1
        } else if step_size > n {
            0
        } else {
            num_ways(n - step_size, step_sizes)
        }
    })
    .sum()
}

The reason why this works is:
1. the first base case: if the stair is as high (n) as the possible number of steps (step_size), there is exactly one way to reach its top: a leap of exactly n (or step_size) steps.
2. the second base case: if the possible step size exceeds the height of the stair, then it's not possible to get to its top, so that's 0 possible ways.
3. Otherwise, the recursive case: if the step size is strictly smaller than the number of steps in the stair, then one can make a jump of size `step_size`, then count the possible ways of reaching the top from the point one ended up at after the jump.
4. Finally, by trying out every possible step size after every jump (hence, .map), one can figure out the number of possible ways for each step, and the total # of ways is the sum of those partial results, since they are independent of each other.",3

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"The problem with the bottom up and memoizing approaches that you have shown an algorithm that requires also an O(N) additional memory. This would be much smoother if it's used the tail recursive approach with O(1) additional memory.
This sample in Scala shows how it can be with tail recursion


@scala.annotation.tailrec
def fib(n: Int, a: BigInt = 0, b: BigInt = 1): BigInt = {
  if (n == 1) {
    b
  } else {
    fib(n - 1, b, a + b)
  }
}



and as the tail recursion just gets optimized to loop, we can rewrite it as loop solution as well


def fibW(n: Int): BigInt = {
  var a: BigInt = 0
  var b: BigInt = 1
  
  for (_ <- n until 1 by -1) {
    val tmp = a + b
    a = b
    b = tmp
  }
  
  b
}


but I prefer the tail recursion as it looks beautiful. :)",0

int fib(int n /*the nth term, starting with the startterm.*/, int startterm, int nextterm)
        {
            if (n == 1) return startterm; //return the first term

And call it like fib(5, 1, 1)...Meaning we want the 5th term in the sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8...I tried this out and it seems to work fine. (in a real program of course i'd have some error checking too. or maybe a public overload for actual use like
int fib(n) { return fib(n, 1, 1); }

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,In a language like ruby or python where the stack is finite for recursion you should almost never use it and opt for a loop implementation but in case you are working with stuff like erlang or haskell or scala you can do this and it is even pretty good often to approach problems this way.,0

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"I think it would be better if fib_bottom_up() is first made a function of fib() to illustrate how one can *systematically* go from recursion -> memoization -> bottom up, where bottom up is just an optimization over the call order of fib() where whenever it's called it's guaranteed to have its dependent values already memorized and thus recursion never happens. Next we can update fib() to remove the recursive call with a memo lookup (and assert if the lookup fails). Finally, and optionally, move the code from fib() into the for loop block, resulting in the final solution that you presented.

e.g.

def fib_bottom_up(n):
  memo = new int[n + 1]

    memo[i] = fib(i, memo)

An array memo makes sense for a function that you expect to take in relatively small integers, but I'm thinking about applying something like this to, say, kinetic calculations in a game engine where you're feeding in floats.  Obviously keeping a single unique entry for every float would explode, but I might be able to bucket some approximations and then apply a linear regression between them for something quick and dirty.",0

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"nice video! However at 8:14 you mention that the time for the memoized recursive solution will be at most 2n + 1 - but it seems to me like it would be just n + 1, because the second call to fib inside the method would already have been memoized by the first call. In the end, it still comes to O(n), but I just wanted to clarify. Thanks!",0
vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"At 8:11, I think 2n-3 should be the answer.
When n=1 or n=2, fib isn't called twice. But he multiplied 2 by N which means he repeated 2  n times, even when N is 1 and 2.
So we subtract 2n+1 by 4, which gives us 2n-3. Can someone please tell me what's wrong here in my answer?
Even when you count the number of times fib is called in the tree provided in the video, you will see that 2n-3 works and gives the right answer, but 2n+1 doesn't.",0

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"Thank you for this video and the other ones, they are great! I would suggest an improvement for the memoized solution though: If you assume that the memo array is initialized with the first two fields set to 1 BEFORE you call the method – as we do – there is no need to treat the first two fields differently in the code. Also, IF you do, I think it should be n==0 || n ==1 instead of n==1 || n == 2. Right?",0

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,At about the 6:30 mark when talking about memoization the array never gets the values of fib(1) or fib(2). The way the code is set up it falls through and then returns fib(1) and fib(2) at the check for n == 1 or n == 2.  The comparison at the end is a nice touch to teach about a potential drawback of a recursive solution.,0

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"Oh, nice video! I used this problem in my robotics club to teach recursion to my programmers. I got this syntax (in java):

class Main {

  public static int fibonacci(int n, int p, int c) {

I really like the second one as well and I didn't think about it. I also liked how you used very well Landau's symbols to compare how different solutions may lead to a great difference in efficiency when applied to a massive amount of datas, something that I'd like to master. 
If I can add something to what other users already said, you should check that n is different from 0, otherwise you'll get an error. Or you could just start the array from 0 and use n-1 instead of n inside the function.

Wall time: 5.99ms (time taken to compute)
The answer (too long to write here)

This is particularly useful if you want to compare different computations.

vYquumk4nWw,What Is Dynamic Programming and How To Use It,"Great video!

Anyway I want to add up something. For this particular application, in the bottom up approach you don't actually need the full array, you just need 3 variables at each step of the loop: start from a=1, b=1 then for each step temp=a+b, a=b, b=temp. Then return b when loop completes. This way you don't have to allocate a huge array, if I want to know the millionth number of the series the full array will occupy a lot of memory since the number will be hundreds of thousands digits long. If we just use 3 variables memory is no more an issue. 

But of course, this just applies for the Fibonacci sequence, it's not a rule!",0

One suggestion for the bottom up approach:  Why use an array to hold ALL the intermediate results? You only need to remember last 2 fib's to get the next one.

P8Xa2BitN3I,Algorithms: Memoization and Dynamic Programming,"This video is awesome! But just two things in good ole code review:
1) The problem should be described as the ""count the paths without going left or right"" according to how the code was written. The more general problem of counting paths that don't loop back on themselves is similar but a bit different.
2) There is a bug in the recursive form of the algorithm presented around 5:48. There should be a check to make sure that (row+1 < len(grid) && col+1 < len(grid[row])).
3) Also, validSquare should really be validRectangle. The recursion has to be built for rectangles even if the inputs will always be squares. =)",0

P8Xa2BitN3I,Algorithms: Memoization and Dynamic Programming,"I think we can solve the last problem with O(n) space complexity. See below for the proposed solution. It's a little informal, but I can elaborate if someone needs, just reply to my comment asking for elaboration. 


Intuition: Using the ""backwards"" approach proposed at the end, we can throw away (or not keep in memory) any results that we aren't going to use again in future calculations as we propagate backwards. We only need to keep track of the values in the ""lowest row"", which means we only need O(n) values to track since a row has length n.



Solution Proposal: 


We only need to track the values in the cells that will definitely have an impact in calculating the values of cells we haven't touched yet. 


Each cell only impacts the values of two other cells (let's call them dependent cells), i.e. the cells to the top and to the left. 


Once we have used a cell to calculate the values in the dependent cells, then we don't need to keep track of the value in the cell any more, only the dependent cells. 


If we start at the bottom rightmost cell and calculate the values of all cells going from right to left and row by row, we'll only ever need to keep track of approximately n values (since n is the size of a row).",0

P8Xa2BitN3I,Algorithms: Memoization and Dynamic Programming,"This code is completely wrong. First of all, memo[n] =fib(n-1) + fib(n--2) is obviously wrong because the function fib accepts two arguments, not one. So it should be memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo). Second of all; else if (memo[n]) is also wrong because you are supposed to be checking if it has *not* been calculated yet so it should be: else if(!memo[n]).",0

From the given example of dynamic programming for the Fibonacci numbers is not obvious what should be the memo[] length. I think the more simpler for understanding example is to use  a HashMap.

 static HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    static int fibonachiDp(int n) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return 1;

nLmhmB6NzcM,4.5 0/1 Knapsack - Two Methods - Dynamic Programming,"There's no conceptual clarity in the video. The problem was solved using the formula. The intention should be to teach the students on how to derive the formula, whereas here, the formula is already given. It is a pompous way of teaching dynamic programming.

This is not the way to learn about Dynamic Programming. Although, I do agree that this class was meant (I assume) for people who want to clear their exams.

My humble request to Sir Abdul Bari is to remake the video based on conceptual clarity and how to think about the formula, and not on how to use the formula. Everyone knows how to substitute values, there's no point in substituting the values. Tell people how the formula came about and that would do the people much good.",0

vgLJZMUfnsU,Matrix Chain Multiplication,"Time complexity is O(n^3) because number of subproblems is O(n^2) and time per subproblem is O(n). 


You get the number of subproblems by asking yourself how many subproblems there are where 2 matrices are being multiplied (answer is n-1), then how many subproblems where 3 matrices are multiplied (n-2) and so on until n matrices (n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + n-4 + ... + 1 = O(n^2)). 


You get the time per subproblem by realizing that the largest subproblem (compute min cost for n matrices) has n possible solutions which you need to compute and then find the minimum of, if the largest subproblem takes O(n) then all other subproblems also take O(n).",0

Prove that every nonempty balanced parenthesis string can be obtained via rule 2 from a unique alpha-beta pair.

Algorithm 10.6 (MatrixMultiplicationOrder)
Input: Dimension D = (d0, d1,...,dn) of n matrices
Output: An array Order in which entry i contains the ith multiplication

1  At each step, choose the largest remaining dimension
2  (among d1,...,dn−1), and multiply two adjacent matrices

the order in which to multiply the matrices, not including the actual
multiplications)?

FtN3BYH2Zes,4.4 Bellman Ford Algorithm - Single Source Shortest Path - Dynamic Programming,"You forgot something.
First, in the initialization part, we set d[v] of all vertices except the source to infinity, but we also set their PARENT to Null.
After each time we update a node, we also update it's parent.
So for example, if d[u] + w[u,v] < d[v] , we set d[v] to d[u] + w[u,v], but also parent(v) = u , because the shortest path comes from u.
This way, when execution has finished, we can recover the shortest path to each node by following the parents to the source.",1

prx1psByp7U,4.3 Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,explanation not good,0
prx1psByp7U,4.3 Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,length is equal not size,0
prx1psByp7U,4.3 Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,"I see a lot of people asking about the s matrix. I may be wrong as I am learning this rn to but I'll see if I can explain this. The fourth step in dynamic programming is to develop an optimal solution. So we need the s matrix to give us information on where we will put the parentheses when displaying our solution.

This pseudo code is from the Introduction to algorithms textbook on this problem

print0ptimal-parens(s, i, j)
  if i == j
    print ""A""i
  else print ""(""
    print0ptimal-parens(s, i, s[i, j])
    print0ptimal-parens(s, i[i, j] + 1, j)
    print "")""

So essentially the optimal solution is broken down into subproblems which are solved optimally. Once we solve the subproblem optimally, the k value which is where we put the parenthesize will be stored in the s matrix. Lastly, on step 4 of dynamic programming, we recursively go through the s array printing out where the optimal brackets go giving our solution.

Just for reference the four steps of dynamic programming are
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.",1

prx1psByp7U,4.3 Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,"I found a nifty shortcut...multiply the dimensions to get a value for each matrix
e.g. from video 5 4 6 2 7
A1 = 5x4 = 20 - 3rd smallest
A2 = 4x6 = 24 - 4th smallest
A3 = 6x2 = 12 - 1st smallest
A4 = 2x7 = 14 - 2nd smallest

Usually I would connect the two smallest together and build up connecting (multiplying) the next smallest ones
(A1(A2(A3 A4))) <- but this order would cause A1 to cross with A2
               ______
  ____(X)| _____ | __ 
  |         |         __ | __
  |         |         |         |
A1     A2     A3     A4

Instead, if that isn't the case, then move on to case two. That is to multiply the smallest and largest values given A2 and A3 in this can, and work backwards by connecting the next largest

s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"Hi Tushar,
Thank you for your video.
Some thoughts:
1.You don't need (in code) the matrix - one row is quite enough
2.Since all info is copied from above the values in current row can be obtained from this same current row
3.Instead of denoting the corresponding cells with T(rue) it's much better and reasonable to do this with numerous of corresponding term-value.
For example, the matrix of the video would be:
[0, f, 2,  f, f, f,  f, f, f, f, f, f]
[0, f, 2, 3, f, 3, f, f, f, f, f, f]
[0, f, 2, 3, f, 3, f, 7, f, 7, 7, f]
[0, f, 2, 3, f, 3, f, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8]
[0, f, 2, 3, f, 3, f, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8]
4.You don't need to do calculations to all the cells - you only need add the value of current row to the values of columns (copied from the above non-negative values)
For example: 
to get the second row from the first one we need only 2 operations:
to add 0+3 -> we get 3 in the column 3=0+3
to add 2+3 -> we get 3 in the column 5=2+3
to get the third row from the second one we need only 3 operations:
to add 0+7 -> we get 7 in the column 7=0+7
to add 2+7 -> we get 7 in the column 9=2+7
to add 3+7 -> we get 7 in the column 10=3+7
to add 5+7 -> we get 7 in the column 12=5+7>11 - in fact we don't need this operation
5.So to get the result we check the column 11.
Since there we have the value 8 - we go to the left by 8 and obtain 3, then go to the left by 3 and obtain 0.
So 11=8+3
Here is the code in python:
#

    a=[0]
    b=[0]+[-1]*m
    for x in li:
        c=[]
        for i in a:
            if i+x<=m and b[i+x]<0:
                b[i+x]=x
                c.append(I+x)
        a.extend(c)
        print(b)
        if b[m]>0:
            print(b)
            result=[b[m]]

s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"Hi, what is the difference between this and Coin change dp, both are requiring same logic right?",0
s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"This approach is great but has a high space complexity (O(w*n) where w is the number of bits you use to represent the required sum and n is the number of items in the list). I tried using a adjacency list instead where the key is the value of the required sum at every step (basically the columns in this matrix) and the value is the list of items which satisfy the sum. I think that it has a lower space complexity. Also, algorithms like these usually have pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Meaning, that the overall time complexity depends on how you represent the total sum required. For example, if the required sum is 100, we are gonna have 0-100 indexes in columns or keys (in my approach). Anyway, thanks for taking your time out and explaining this stuff Tooshar :D",1

s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,sir is this only valid for sorted array,0
s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"Using whatever little knowledge I have, here's the reasons why the Subset Sum problem can be classified as a DP prob:

1) Optimal Substructure:
Say the required sum(S) is given by: S = X + Y where X and Y are two other sums(possibly equal to 0)
Hence, the problem reduces to finding optimal solutions to finding sum equal to X and Y. Thus, the question has Optimal Substructure property

2)Overlapping Subproblems:
Say we need to find a subset with sum S. Say the current element is P. Then we need to find if there exists a subset with sum (S-P). Checking for sum (S-P) may already have been computed. For ex.:
Array => {1,3,5,6,8,9} S = 19
After processing elements 1,3,5, current sum = 9. Then, we start finding whether a subset with sum = 10 exists or not.
Similarly, after processing elements 3,6, current sum = 9. Again, we start finding whether a subset with sum = 10 exists or not.
Hence, we are checking for the getting the same sum more than once. Thus, the question has Optimal Subproblems property

I hope this helps :)",0
s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"similar to Subset Sum Problemwhich asks us to find if there
 is a subset whose sum equals to target value. For this problem, the 
target value is exactly the half of sum of array.

Following are the two main steps to solve this problem:

1) Calculate sum of the array.  If sum is odd, there can not be two subsets with equal sum, so return false.

2) If sum of array elements is even, calculate sum/2 and find a subset of array(video method) with sum equal to sum/2.",0

s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"Hello Tushar,

I am new to your videos but very glad that I have found them. I just have one question, about your algorithm to actually find the subset, after the matrix of boolean's has been calculated. What if instead we had the matrix {2, 1, 7, 8, 10}, so the subset to equal 11 is {1, 10}. The algorithm you gave for finding  the actual subset, in this case, would be {1, 8}. How can the algorithm you gave be adapted to possibly include the last number of the input {10}. Thanks.",0
s6FhG--P7z0,Subset Sum Problem Dynamic Programming,"Hi Tushar. First of all, I'd like to say thank you, many of your videos have been of great help to me. Second, I have a question about the code that you provided on your GitHub repository...is the ""sum"" inside the method ""partition"" just a sum, i.e. a value that we ourselves could change? Say, could I just set sum to equal 11 and get ""true"" given the same example you used in the video, i.e. with arr = {2, 3, 7, 8, 10}?",0

ENyox7kNKeY,"20. Dynamic Programming II: Text Justification, Blackjack",Pretty poor demonstration of the BlackJack game. Eric took a dealer hit on 17 which is not allowed. Victor incorrectly stood on soft 18 against a 9 and 10. An intuitive explanation of why the dealer has an advantage is that he gets to go last i.e. if both player and dealer bust the player busts first and loses.  The cheating method of a perfect information deck was accomplished in the 1970s by a cheat swapping in his own pre-arranged shoe for the dealers. This resulted in the card shoes being chained to the BlackJack table. On the upside Eric has great handwriting. fun lecture overall.,1

1.  Explain why you chose to use dynamic programming vs. recursion vs. some other scheme.
2.  Explain why you are doing the min and why each flow of information (either from above or from the left) exists.  You explain the mechanics but not the structure of the solution so your video helps me understand how this technique works but does not give me any intuition into where else I might use this solution.  
3.  Contrast this problem from other similar problems.  For example the problem to list the number of ways you can make change from a given denomination of coins for a certain amount.

Otherwise, thanks a lot.",54

In this case however, I think that a O(N) solution with O(1) space is possible.

No  -> count++ -> Then any of the four conditions 1) check next chars are the same -> i++; j++ OR 2) First String char @ i == next String char @ j + 1 -> i++   OR 3) First String char @ i + 1 == Second String char @ j => j++ OR ELSE 4) i++; j++ and continue?

By your algorithm, it should be the minimum of {0, 1, 1} + 1 and so the answer for the a, a square will be 1 not 0. The correct answer for a cell is the minimum of the top element, the left element and the diagonal element + either 0 or 2. 0 if the most recent characters are the same and 0 if the most recent characters are different. Here is a link explaining how that works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxx0b7djCrs.",1

We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,excellent video sir..,0
We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,"I have few suggestions,
1. As many people have pointed out, I don't think I'm getting to know why this solution works before seeing the complete video.  It would be helpful if Tushar goes over other approaches as well to prove that this solution works or mathematical proof shall be sufficient.

2. I think it would be better if the video explains what happens to the string(s) when we delete a character(s) and how the comparison shall be made rather than asking to the take the minimum of top, left and diagonal

3. Adding to the second point, if the characters are not same, I don't think it is just 1 + Min(cost(top), cost(dia), cost(left)). I think it shall be min(1 + cost(top), 1 + cost(left), 2 + cost(dia)). Because, when we are taking from the diagonal we are removing one element from str1 and one from str2. Assuming cost of removal is 1, it shall be 2 + cost(diag) rather than 1 + cost(dia)

I welcome any suggestions for correction.",7

We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,"Hey, I feel you should also hover over optimal subproblems and what a state of the DP represents, For example, In this question, when not equal, you take the min of(top,left,diagonal) , where in you should explain that the top refers to inserting a[i], left refers to deleting a[i] and diagonal refers to editing a[i]. 
On a side note, you should have mentioned the case where the cost of edit, insert and delete are different.",63

We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,"What if the first string would be all 'a's, then the minimum edition distance from 'a' (string 2) to 'aaaaaa' would be 0, which would be wrong cause you need to delete 5 'a's.

Am I missing something?",1
We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,"+Tushar Roy In source code, I believe assuming string2 is modified according to string 1...  if T[i][j] == T[ i-1 ][ j ] + 1   ""Delete in String 1"" ... Should be changed to Insert in string 1.  We are not supposed to delete in both string1 and string 2",0
We3YDTzNXEk,Minimum Edit Distance Dynamic Programming,"No body could explain me better than this, thank you and thank you, however although you explained why when we have two equals we should go diagonal you didn't explain why in inequality we get three minimums and plus it to 1,I played with giving an example for myself and I understood that part! 
When they are Not equal:

First we suppose that last char is not there and we go for previous chars
we need to see what permutations takes the least operations to have the conversion, after that we need 1 operation to add the one we supposed to get rid of it in the beginning so that is why we have minimum plus 1 here

One suggestion though...
instead of directly jumping to the matrix right from start...
it would be awesome if you could explain the solution for a min or 30 seconds, in terms of what you will be doing before jumping to solving of the table.
Although you kind of mention the formula in the end, but it would be better if it is verbally explained at the beginning and then mathematically written at the end. That would help people in understanding that how DP can solve this problem in the first place.",9

nqlNzOcnCfs,Dynamic Programming Interview Question #1 - Find Sets Of Numbers That Add Up To 16,"Your time complexity calculations are a bit off.  If you call dp twice per per call, you end up with exponential growth.  So without dynamic programing, you'd call the the function 2^n times, not n*2 times.  with dp, you can sometimes lower this as there is only total*n possible values for ""total:i"", which makes the complexity O(min(2^n, total*n)). 


Also, you don't really need to test if total < arr[i] as dp(arr, total - arr[i], i-1, mem) will trigger total < 0 and return 0 right away.",2

nqlNzOcnCfs,Dynamic Programming Interview Question #1 - Find Sets Of Numbers That Add Up To 16,"My instinct is to generate a tree search algorithm. If I was being more fancy, I'd say that since the numbers must as up to a given argument, we can process the input array to omit all entries greater than the target argument. Then I'd start with Target value and start breaking it into smaller numbers. Eg 16 = 15 + 1 = 14 + 2 = 13 + 3 = ... Then break the left most numbers are many times as there are elements in the input array. The rules stipulate that no internet may be used twice so whenever a break generates a number more that once, we kill the branch and continue. At the very end, every node containing the broken numbers is acted on by a function that deletes all elements of the processed input array. Count the number of empty nodes. That is our answer. Nodes that end up non-empty at the end cannot be implemented with the I input array. Nice question, fun brain teaser to wake up to 😊. I'm a simple boy so in practice If just use a tree search algorithm, even though it's not so efficient. If you wanted something faster, then I might use the second graph approach",0

It says: If the given total is 4, there would be no way of finding a subset out of these three elements that add up to four which includes the current item 6. So that means the number of subsets that add up to the total amount out of these 3 elements is equivalent to the number of subsets that add up to the total amount out of these two elements instead.
my question is Isn't we can only choose 4 out of the two elements ? Then it will be not equivalent.


And also at 11:20 
It says: the number of subsets that add up to the given total 6 which include this number 6 is equivalent to the number of subsets that add up to total minus the current item so total - arr[i] out of these 2 elements only.

3.if you define the function ""dp(arr,total,i,mem)"" as a sub function of the function ""count_sets_dp"" then you can do it as ""dp(total, i)"" (two parameters less)

But I later realized that there is a problem with this approach, the algorithm does not accept the fact that there can be number later in the input vector which can complete the sum but it returns from that point itself.

I was able to list a few subsets but missed a few corner cases where a bigger number appeared first in the input vector. Can you suggest what can be done in that case??.

nqlNzOcnCfs,Dynamic Programming Interview Question #1 - Find Sets Of Numbers That Add Up To 16,"I have a little idea. Not exactly dp, but maybe close.
arr will be the name of given array. 
I create an array of n possible sums of subsets not higher than the required one (in this case i just write 17), storing the number of subsets with that sum.
int a[17] = {1,0,0,...,0};
Last element is a[16]. Right now its 0. We will find it.
Then, i do this
For ( i = 0; i++; i < arr.length ) {
    For ( j = 0; j++; j <= 16 - arr[i] ) {
         If(a[j]) {
             a[j + arr[i]] += a[j];
         };
     };
};
Basically, i iterate through the given array. Each iteration will count the new subsets that are added to the old set of sub sets by that element. Example, with 2 old sets [2,3] and [5] with sum 5, adding a 6 will add 2 subsets with sum 11, those are [2,3,6] and [5,6]. Therefore when we work with the element 6, a[11] += a[5].
There. I then return a[16].
I think this is kinda a bottom up dynamic programming, because later steps use results from last steps's ""memoize thingy"".
Opinions please?",0

Just one suggestion in the final solution: it is not necessary to add the 4th condition (i.e. total < arr[i]). If that is the case, dp(arr, total - arr[i], i - 1, mem) will return 0 due to the 2nd condition.

However, I understand that by keeping the 4th condition you'll save a few insertions in the call stack, which is something that Python does not handle very efficiently.",0

PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,"If this were an unbounded knapsack problem, would row 1, column 4 have a value of 6? Because the weight of the first item is only 2 kg and in the 4th column, our knapsack has a capacity of 4 meaning 2 kg is still left. Therefore another copy of the first item can fit? Obviously, more changes would occur throughout the table but I am just giving one example. I am just trying to understand this for my own sake.",0

PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,for weight =4 max item =2 he can also take 2 weight+2weight = 6 benefit instead of (3+1) wight = 4,2
PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,I think You should first explain the recursive relation before applying it to fill the table.,1
PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,thank you,0
PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,Worth adding for completion that if weight < 0 in the table the value is minus infinity. So that when w-w_j < 0 the value is not taken.,0

PLJHuErj-Tw,Dynamic Programming:0/1 Knapsack Problem,"For anyone who didn't understand by watching the video, try making a table yourself. This helped me to figure it out (with the help of the video, of course.)

Basically, the way it works is that the previous row is the optimal solution for every weight limit, assuming that only the items of that row and up are available. So the 0 row, all the answers are zero because there are zero items available to take. The 1 row is the maximum value for every weight limit from 0 to 5 when only item 1 is available. The 2 row is the maximum value for every weight limit from 0 to 5 if only items 1 and 2 are available. And so on.

So for any given cell in the table, to find what the value should be, you compare the values if you don't take the current row's item (which will be equal to the cell above it) compared to the value if you do take the current row's item (which will be the sum of the value of the current item plus the cell from the above row at the weight limit which is equal to the remaining amount of weight that you can carry after taking the current item.)

And trying to work out the problem by hand helped me to understand why this is reasonable.",0

Thank you so much for this.

After going through the Divide and Conquer paradigm, I was, of the opinion, that factorial and fibonacci would fall in the ""decreasing functions"" in Divide and Conquer as the problem keeps getting reduced ultimately to the ""small problem"" from where it bounces back up. While I understand you were showing the example of Fibonacci here just to explain tabulation and memoization, is there any chance, you were also implying that fibonacci could be cited as an example of dynamic programming?

Request your thoughts.",0

Greedy Vs Dynamic: 
1) both used to solve optimisation problem - find maximum or minimum 
2) both start by selecting local optimal value - i.e. global optimum can be obtained by selecting local optimum. 
3) But greedy doesn’t change its choice/selection criteria while dynamic can change its choice/selection criteria (Greedy pre-define rule to solve the problem without changing at any step/sequence until final step). This is the main difference between Greedy & Dynamic.
4) optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solution to sub-problems ie. problem can be solved by sequence by sequence - step by step.
5) Greedy may not give correct (optimal) result always but dynamic always give correct (optimal) result.",0

     c = a + b;

ocZMDMZwhCY,"21. DP III: Parenthesization, Edit Distance, Knapsack","Maybe I am late as hell, but when talking about edit distance in such detail that we have a value dependent replacement costs, then why did the lecturer discarded options of symmetric operations on x, y.
Specifically, he mentioned inserting in x, and deleting in x, and left out deleting from y and inserting into y, but if the deletion cost is different than the insertion cost then the following example would have incorrect solution:

deletion cost = 1
insertion cost = 10
x = """"
y = ""ABC""

since the original solution only cares about how can we manipulate x to get y the result would be 30, because we cannot delete anything from an empty string.
If this asymmetry is present, then the editDistance would not satisfy the requirements of a distance function, but still at 36:05 he states ""[these three options] covers every possible thing you can do"".

The edges point downwards and signify adding an item to backpack. Edge weight are the values. You'd find the longest path from Start to End where they are both 'dummy' nodes. All vertices have an edge to 'End' of length 0. The start node would have edges to all 'N' items are the levels corresponding to their weight,",0

ocZMDMZwhCY,"21. DP III: Parenthesization, Edit Distance, Knapsack","What I've been missing from these lectures so far (particularly for the knapsack problem) is the insight that _'recursion + memoization DP'_ can be much more efficient than _'bottom up DP'_ if you don't ultimately need the solutions to _all_ sub-problems in order to solve the original problem.

For instance, if you have a knapsack capacity of 10 and four item-sizes 1, 3, 6 and 8, then you'll never need solutions for a remaining capacity of 5 or 8, because no combination of items take up size 5 or size 2.

I suppose you can get around this by reformulating the set of sub-problems to exclude those, but it'll be very inconvenient to systematically iterate over such an awkward set.",6

vLS-zRCHo-Y,4.6 Optimal Binary Search Tree - Dynamic Programming,"For those who don't understand the formula here is an explanation. It took a while for me too.
Everytime you try to add the nth node on to a tree with n - 1 nodes, you have to pick a root point k and k - 1 nodes on the left tree, n - k nodes on the right tree.
k - 1 and n - k each as INDIVIDUAL TREE should already be calculated previously according to the table, so you just have to find where those are on the table which is at c[0, k - 1] and c[k, n]
Look now we have the rank of 2 trees and 1 single root, to push the left or right tree into a sub tree you need add one level on each of their node therefore add the entire weight of the tree
The combined tree with k as root have:
Rank(k) = Rank(left) + Rank(left) + weight(left) + weight(right) + weight(root) = Rank(left) + Rank(right) + weight(0 - n)
= c[0, k-1] + c[k, n] + w(0, n)",34

xOlhR_2QCXY,0-1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming),"Great video, have been looking for a clear and concise answer to this problem. 

I struggled a bit adapting the syntax to Javascript so here it is as implemented in the Knapsack Light challenge on codefights and codewars if anyone's interested: 

function knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) {
    let values = [0, value1, value2];
    let weights = [0, weight1, weight2];
    let resArr = [];
    function consider(n, C){
        let res;
        if(n === 0 || C === 0){
            res = 0;
        } else if(weights[n]>C){
            res = consider(n-1, C);
        } else{
            let tmp1 = consider(n-1, C)
            let tmp2 = values[n] + consider(n-1, C - weights[n])
            res = Math.max(tmp1, tmp2)
        }
        return res;
    }
    var finalRes = consider(2, maxW)
    return finalRes
}



And with dynamic programming: 

function knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) {
    let values = [0, value1, value2];
    let weights = [0, weight1, weight2];
    function fillArray(n) {
        var arr = Array.apply(null, Array(n));
        return arr.map(() => undefined);
    }
    let resArr = fillArray(3);
    for(i=0;i<resArr.length;i++){
        resArr[i] = fillArray(maxW);
    }

    function consider(n, C){
        let res;
        if(resArr[n][C] != undefined){
            return resArr[n][C]
        } 
        if(n === 0 || C === 0){
            res = 0;
        } else if(weights[n]>C){
            res = consider(n-1, C);
        } else{
            let tmp1 = consider(n-1, C)
            let tmp2 = values[n] + consider(n-1, C - weights[n])
            res = Math.max(tmp1, tmp2)
        }
        resArr[n][C] = res;
        return res;
    }
    var finalRes = consider(2, maxW)
    return resArr[resArr.length - 1][resArr[2].length-1]
}",0
xOlhR_2QCXY,0-1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming),"Thanks for this great tutorial, but I think there is a problem if I'm not mistaken!
The Idea from the Dynamic Programming is to memorize the sub problems to optimize the performance in case we have to get a result for a sub problems, right?
In your code, the arr will not contain all the sub problems, e.g if we have 3 items with 3 weights, and Knapsack capacity equals to 50, we should have an arr[4][51] of results, but in your example it's just have 10 results.
and my question is, How could we retrieve the knapsack for a sub problem in yours?

Phase 1 - fills up the cost and distance data structure and bears a striking similarity to Dijkstra's where we find the vertex with the shortest path to the preceding stage starting from the sink
Phase 2 - uses the populated data structure from Phase 1 to trace its way back from the source to sink.

My questions are: 
i. I am trying to make the most of the individual points you mentioned about Dynamic Programming: (a) memoization/tabulation and (b) decision making at each stage. In this particular case, Phase 1 seems to be doing the tabulation part where you fill in the data structure to use it later in Phase 2. And as you said in the video, the decision making part happens in the second Phase: the Forward method. Please correct me if I am wrong. If my understanding is right then, this leads me into the second question.
ii. Where is the decision making happening in Phase 2 considering the data structure from Phase 1 has already given you the path or at least the vertex to be chosen at each stage and we are just using the one and only obvious vertex at each stage as populated in the data structure from Phase 1 to trace back to the sink starting from the vertex!

EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"How do I set keep [ i ] [ j ] to 1 if the value above is the same but the cost is lower? For example if we have a knapsack of weight 6, and we have two items, given in this order : 6(5), 5(5) where an item is represented by weight(value) notation. If we simply only wrote a 1 in the keep matrix if the value is greater than the row above, we would actually use item 6(5) which clearly is not as efficient as just selecting the 5(5) item.

EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"Thank you! you helped me a lot! 
1st: we should know that we can use the item i to be in the knapsack or not.
max{v(i-1),x  OR v(i)+v(i-1),x-w(i)} 
if we want to use the item i  then we should consider the remaining space that we may have to use so we would use the item i with value i and we would add the value of the item before and the capacity is the remaining which is the one you told us.
OR we don't use the item i because when we use it hasn't a good high acceptable value and it just make knapsack  heavy

EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"not sure if this was said in a previous comment or not, but in the end when you go back through the keep table to see which items to put in the knapsack, I think you circle the wrong items so its a little hard to follow.  When looking at I=3, W=5 and seeing a 1 in the keep table, the 1 should indicate the third item is being chosen, but the first item is circled.  Hope this helps with anyone's confusion.
",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"I know the purpose of the video is to demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic programming, but from a strictly game theory approach, if the knapsack can hold W=5, and the third object is only W=1 with a V=4, wouldn't the best strategy be to pack 5 of the third object? Because that'd give a total knapsack value of 5*4=20 which is far superior to the calculated answer of total V=9. I guess I'm just curious as to why the program would output a non-optimal answer.",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"> You can do it from the right instead...
OK, I got that part.
 
> Then, for the keep array... after he finished: 1 1 3 3 1
What do you mean?  Could you point me to some psuedo code for the ""keep"" part?",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"You might actually have to modify the DP to only store ""The best value we can get with exactly weight W"" rather than ""The best value we can get with weight less than or equal to W""",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"You can do it from the right instead.  And when you do it from the right, you can actually just use the same row and overwrite it, instead of having a different row for every time you add a new item.

Then, for the keep array, instead of storing 1 or 0, you'll store the weight of the item that was last used to reach there.  So in the example he gives, the keep array would look like this after he finished: 1 1 3 3 1
And it would be ""the last item we used had weight X"" and then you backtrack.",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"I guess we should take a step back.  This idea works for all numbers of additional constraints in that it reduces the dimension you need by 1.  So for the original problem with only 1 constraint, you'll only need a 1 dimensional array. If you can understand that, then applying that idea to more constraints is relatively straightforward.

It all depends on how you store the keep array, and how you iterate through the regular array.  See how in the video, he iterates from the left?  You can d",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"OK, you don't need to store the entire V matrix to solve the problem.  But I can't see how you can not store the entire keep matrix and solve the problem.  You need the keep matrix to back track at the end.",0

EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,... and the 2D way?,0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"Except instead of looking at the previous row, you'd look at the whole previous 2D array.  And instead of only subtracting the 'weight' of the current object, you subtract both the 'mass' and the 'volume' and then look back that cell in the previous 2D array.

The keep array would be done the same way, I suppose.

In order to do this with only a 2D array used for the keep, instead of storing '1' or '0' to indicating using the item, you would store the mass and volume of the last item used.",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"No, so I'll go into a bit more detail how to do it with a 2-D array.

Suppose we have two limiting constrints, M mass and V volume.  Our objects that we want to place into our bag have distinct value c, mass m and volume v.  We want to select the best set of items to maximize our value without using too much mass or volume.

The 3D way is to have, for each of our N objects, a 2-D array of M+1 x V+1 dimension.

Then you would apply the same process as demonstrated in this video.",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,Don't you need a 3 dimensional keep array?,0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"I'm thinking the problem with two constraints can be solved with two three dimensional arrays, but I'm not sure about the details.",0
EH6h7WA7sDw,The 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Dynamic Programming Method,"Yeah, but then the complexity will go to O(nmv) runtime and O(nmv) space.  The problem is the O(nmv) space because that will get to be pretty large even if both m and v are relatively small.  You can improve it to O(mv) space, but it still is pretty bad.

Just one clarification, instead of the complexity of recursion being O(2^n) wouldn't it be O(2^(m+n)) in the worst case where length of LCS is 0. In that case there will be m+n levels in the recursion tree, so the number of nodes O(2^(m+n)) and hence the complexity.",0

GMzVeWpyTN0,Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,"Great video and great explanation. But it's only half of the solution. There are TWO matrices to be filled simultaneously throughout this (or any other dynamic programming) algorithm. The first matrix m[ , ] for the optimal values - which is the one you filled, and the second matrix s[ , ] for storing  the optimal values of k for each corresponding optimal value computed (those k values you magically ""recalled"" at the end). Without constructing the second matrix s[ , ] for storing the optimum choices for k at each m[i,j], there's no way for a computer to re-construct the optimal parenthesization from the table m[ , ].",1

GMzVeWpyTN0,Matrix Chain Multiplication - Dynamic Programming,"Hello. First off, a great set of videos. Thank you.

Here in this problem, the cost of multiplication,
M[i,j] = M[i,k] + M[k+1,j] + (p.values)

Here what are the p-values, and how does one know when/how/if-at-all to add it.
Point being, for any arbitrary problem, how do we find the cost of the problem as a function of costs of the sub-problems ? Isn't that the trick here?

Here the p-values, so to speak, showed up rather un-intuitively for me. 
Please help me understand a more general approach here.",0

You show us that a optimal policy must satisfy Bellman’s Optimality Equation. And you show us this iterative method that can only terminate at a policy that satisfies Bellman’s Optimality Equation. 

However:
policy is optimal => policy satisfies Bellman’s Optimality Equation              (1)
is not the same as
policy satisfies Bellman’s Optimality Equation => policy is optimal              (2)

Nd1-UUMVfz4,RL Course by David Silver - Lecture 3: Planning by Dynamic Programming,"-- At 28:00 I can see an *error* on the k = 3 left grid. 
For (2 row 3 column cell) it should be arrows in all directions (from -3.0 to all -2.9).
And or course the same is for the (3 row 3 column cell).
So ""optimal policy"" is not yet here for k=3

-- Also at 25:00 on the right grids: all cells on the border cannot have arrows directed outside. It is important because we don't calculate probability of steps to outside. Say, cells in the corners have only two possible steps which has 0.5 probability etc.",1

Nd1-UUMVfz4,RL Course by David Silver - Lecture 3: Planning by Dynamic Programming,"It's called dynamic programming because the Air Force general Bellman was working under was somewhat short sighted and didn't appreciate the value of quantitative research.

Also ""...we can think of the value function as caching the solutions to all of our subproblems...."" is great stuff. Many thanks.",8
Nd1-UUMVfz4,RL Course by David Silver - Lecture 3: Planning by Dynamic Programming,"The person asking the question at 28:07 is mistaken, and the lecturer's answer is incorrect. The incorrect premise of the question is that the only ""terminal state"" is the lower right corner, and so the square (3,3) (labelled from the bottom left) should be ""further"" from the terminal point than (4,3). This is wrong: the top left corner is also part of the terminal state, and is closer to (3,3). Dr. Silver's answer does not address this. Instead, he (apparently incorrectly) says the discrepancy is due to rounding error. However, the numbers shown are consistent with an exact solution of the problem by solving Poisson's equation for the random walk.",28

HgUOWB0StNE,Dynamic Programming | Set 4 (Longest Common Subsequence) | GeeksforGeeks,"*For everyone asking why the matrix is built this way* :
When you are using dynamic programming you need to understand the recursive algorithm you would like to optimize.
I'll explain the non-genius solution where you go letter by letter from the start of each string.
The DP answer will be built bottom-up which would make the table fill from the end of the string as the vid suggests.


In this case (x is L1, y = L2): 
LCS = { 
    1 + LCS(i+1,  j+1) ; IF x[i]==y[j] 
    max(LCS(i+1,  j),  LCS(i,  j+1))  ; ELSE
}
This is the top-down approach.


Now if you would like to convert the recursive solution to a matrix you need to take a bottom-up approach. And so the algorithm will look as follows:
LCS = [N][M] // N = len(x), M = len(y)

if x[i]==y[j]:
    LCS[i][j] = 1 + LCS[i-1][j-1]
else:
    LCS[i][j] = max(LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1])
Note that the matrix has to have a initialization row and column where all values are 0 in order to have an answer for i-1 and j-1 in the first run.
So if you are coding you should also use the case: 
if (x[i] == 0 || y[j] == 0) -> LCS[i][j] = 0 


You can easily see the correlation between the recursive and the DP solutions.
Just keep practicing, it is a skill worth working for and not black magic (as some may feel after watching this video).",1

It may look weird and confusing the first time you see this kind of proof, so pay attention and try to follow:
Think of it as if we're given AS A FACT that the route named R from origin city 'a' to destination city 'j' is the shortest.
We're not trying to prove that. It's a given fact!
Now what we actually want to prove is that any sub-route inside R (for example from 'a' to some midpoint 'k' that is located between 'a' and 'j') would ALSO be the shortest route to that midpoint.
And why is that?? Because if there would exist a different route from 'a' to 'k' that is shorter, then you could also use it to improve R and reach faster to the final destination 'j'. But that's a contradiction to the GIVEN FACT that we have in the first place (that R is already the shortest).
Thus you prove that any sub-path within a given shortest path, is ALSO a shortest path....",8

And the proof was not to be made about whether R(a.k) is itself the shortest path from a to k or not. This is another subject. He started where we already knew that R(a.k) is the optimal path from a to k.",0

Just a heads up: the more optimal implementation uses only O(B) space where B is the initial length of the rod. It is the same as for knapsack with repetition. T(b) = max(T(i-1, b-ai) + vi, T(i-1, b)) . You iterate through all the rod lengths for each entry and update the max. So it is still O(nB), but with improved space complexity. Cheers!",1

IRwVmTmN6go,Cutting Rod dynamic programming,"Thanks Tushar for explaining the problem and its solution. Great work!

This problem seems to be similar to knapsack where in both cases we try to maximize our profit for a input range that we can select from to fill it upto a certain upper limit / value.

However in case of knapsack, for a item 'i' weight (w[i]) which can be selected, when going back , we go back in the row above to the item being selected i.e T[i-1][j-w[i]] 

In this case, when we go back we seem to back in the same row  i.e T[i][j-w[i]].

Can you please explain why this difference? In both the cases we try to pick a combination of values from the input range (either weight[] / rod length[]) at any time and not just consider individual items one at a time.


Just thinking in both cases if there is any issue, in case if we do it consistently ?",2

_fgjrs570YE,Coin Changing Number of ways to get total dynamic programming,"It's seriously hilarious to see so bad comments for a teacher who explains things like a cakewalk.
Thanks @Tushar Roy. Keep it up.

For those who didn't understand the logic, ponder upon the following things and you will learn.
1. The first column value is one not zero because we can get the denomination without selecting anything.
2. The pattern for solving this question is so intuitive, like if you want to get 4 from only two's then you will get in that number of ways which is equal to getting 2's, because when you get 2's adding a 2 denomination coin will get you 4.
Similarly, if you want to get 6 from two's only, then it is the number of ways getting 4 from two's only.
And as you have calculated for the lower denomination coin, you have to add the lower denomination coin value. That's all.

So, the formula becomes, T[i][j] = T[i-1][j] + T[i][j-val[i]] with handling the other conditions.

_fgjrs570YE,Coin Changing Number of ways to get total dynamic programming,"Good video Tushar - but you skip over a lot of assumptions.

Easy way to understand the mysterious ""add 1"".  No need of zero column.
Assume ""i"" represents row (coins) and ""j"" represents numbers 0->n, n being the target total.
* If coins[i] < j --> copy value from above column
* If coins[i] == j --> Take value from left and add 1 to it.  This is because, when this condition is met, you are adding one more possibility of combinations.
Example: Take case of ""coins[i] = j = 3"".  
When coins[i] = 3 and j = 2, your value is 2.  You can make ""2"" as (1, 1 or 2) only.
When coins[i] = 3 and j = 3, you can make ""3"" as (1,1,1 or 1,2 or 3).
This is true whenever coins[i] = j .

_fgjrs570YE,Coin Changing Number of ways to get total dynamic programming,"First row has been talked about below, it's not always just 1 (it was here because any positive integer % 1 = 0)

The number of spaces he goes back is only one, two, three because those are the denominations he used in his example. If the denominations were 2, 3, 5, that's how far you'd look back when he starts adding the cell above and the cell to the left. As he properly stated, you only look back if j >=coins[i], or in other words, if counting backwards coins[i] times doesn't send you off the left end of the matrix. Another way to think about it is if the denomination is larger than the amount of change you're looking to return, that denomination will never occur in a solution set of T[i][j].

Generalize the problem with d denominations in an array D[0..d-1] instead of going straight into concrete numbers, it's way easier.",0

UhFvK3uERGg,Programming Interview: 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming),"This video doesn't go along with the formula specified. Eg at 19:48, He says B(2,5)= max{B(1,5) , 4+B(2,2)} which is wrong. B(2,5) = max{ B(1,5) , 4 + B(1,2) }. Although the result is the same, it is conceptually wrong to use B(2,2) instead of B(1,2). To go further, 4+B(1,2) means you take item 2 and then check if item 1 can fit in the remaining space for weight after adding item 2. ie 5-3=2 is the remaining weight. So, since you can fit item 1 with weight 2, you add its benefit which is B(1,2)=3. I hope you make necessary changes. Thanks. ",11

W2ote4jCuYw,Dynamic Programming Introduction,"It's ridiculous how we have to know this at uni, but in reality it is completely impractical and unnecessary.",2
W2ote4jCuYw,Dynamic Programming Introduction,"This video is wrong for so many reasons:
- The 'run time of Fibonacci' is not defined, because it depends on implementation. You chose to use the recursive solution. That is why your default is O(2^n)
- The run time of the iterative method is O(n), not Omega(n^2), whatever that means 
- You are demonstrating memoization, not dynamic programming
- Your memoization solution is no more 'bottom up' than the default recursive solution (which is 'bottom up' for the same reason - you recurse to your base case and then build up)
- Finally, in reality dynamic programming is just an interview exercise. It is never, ever used by any practicing programmer, just like no practicing programmer has ever had to compute the Fibonacci sequence, write a factorial function, divide without division, or any of the other nonsense we're asked in interviews. But that makes your confident ignorance even more tragic because people seeking to pass interviews will listen to your errant nonsense and fail.",13

3hcaVyX00_4,Egg Dropping Dynamic Programming,"@Tushar
Solution will always come when you drop first egg from floor/2 floor and when consider the cases.
For example for floor =6, we do 6/2 = 3, we drop from floor 3, there are two possibilities
1)Egg breaks in which case we have 2 floors and 1 egg
2)Egg doesn't break, in which case we have 3 floors and 2 eggs
so, solution will be 1+max(2,2) = 3

So, time complexity will reduce to n*k, rather than n*(k^2)

Please tell if I am missing something.

P.S., I think in case of even no. of floors, we will need to consider both n/2 and ((n/2)+1), but not the rest.",4

3hcaVyX00_4,Egg Dropping Dynamic Programming,"Hi, 

Thanks a lot for your videos. I am a great fan of yours. I have a question regarding the tabulation in all the dynamic programming problems you solve. In each problem , the qay you start is different . I know that each problem has a different requirement but still, for some problems you start with 0th row and 0th column and for some with 1. For e.g in the rod cutting problem, you directly say, in the first row, we take the rod length from 0 to 5, but in the egg dropping puzzle, you start from one to number of floors and you started with an empty set in Travelling salesman. Also,  how do you determine which is the row and which is column ?

3hcaVyX00_4,Egg Dropping Dynamic Programming,"for n floors and 2 eggs , the min number of attempts to find where eggs breaks is n formula being n(n+1)/2 = numberofsteps. For ex : take 10 floors and 2 eggs  -  start with 4 th floor - if it breaks then one could find with the other egg starting with 1st floor in (1 + 3 (1st floor ,then 2nd ...then 4th floor) ) , if it doesn't break try  7th floor , if it breaks then try with second egg from 5th - 7th floor - so number of attempts is 1+1+2( 4th,7th,5th,6th)  ... similar logic for 9th floor and 10th floor ... 
Logic is lets say egg is dropped at different floors x,y,z,,, abs( (0-x) + (x+1-y) + (y+1-z)...) should be equal to n . and they should be consecutive. so n*(n+1)/2 = numberofsteps",0

GafjS0FfAC0,Programming Interview: Dynamic Programming: Coin Change Problem,"There is a Big problem in this solution which leads to the wrong answer
eg. 
Say the coin set is {1,2,5,10} and amount is 3. I think this theory fails in this case.
C(0) = 0, C(1)=1, C(2)=1, C(3) should be 2 {1,2}. But this formula returns 1.
So how i assumed is:
C(3) = MIN {C(3-1), C(3-2), C(3-5)} + 1
       = MIN {C(2), C(1), C(-2)} + 1 [assumed C ( <0 ) = 0 too]
       = MIN {1,1,0} + 1
       = 0 + 1
       = 1
This is wrong cause it will take 2 coins {1,2} to make 3.

this can be resolved if we take c(-Ve)=infinity , which denotes that -Ve value can't be possible .
now lets try the same problem
:
C(3) = MIN {C(3-1), C(3-2), C(3-5)} + 1
       = MIN {C(2), C(1), C(-2)} + 1 [assumed C ( <0 ) = infinity ]
       = MIN {1,1,infinity} + 1
       = 1 + 1
       = 2
now  it will take 2 coins {1,2} to make 3. ",0

then C(0) = 0, C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 1
so C(4) = min {C(4-2), C(4-3)} +1 = min{C(2),C(1)}+1 = min{1,0}+1=0+1=1

4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,"in the inner loop over j, where it has D[j] < D[i] - that isn't comparing the 'tail' of any previously found sequence, it is comparing the the j'th entry in the input vector with the ith entry in the input vector, and that ignores what comes between j and i - I had to change that in a C# implementation - I'm sure it's a bug in the code - unless I mis-understood vectors.",1
4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,"This DP design idea is ""limit the original sequence length-budget"" and reuse them, which is presented nicely in the video, however I don't see the code/ explanation handle below situations:

video@4:07"", L[4] should be BOTH {2, 4, 5 } AND {3,4,5} ...",2

4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,"Thanks Bo for the nicely explained video. 
But do we need the LIS to be a vector of vectors? For the code below, I am using two vector<int> arrays - one to store largest sequence length at each item and the other to store the index to the previous item

 void LongestIncreasingSubsequence()
 {
  cout << ""Enter integers separated by space, CTRL-Z to finish"" << endl;
  vector<int> vec(istream_iterator<int>(cin), {});

  vector<int> lis(vec.size());
  vector<int> lischain(vec.size());
  fill(lis.begin(), lis.end(), 1);
  fill(lischain.begin(), lischain.end(), -1);

  int maxLen = 0, maxIdx = -1;
  for (int i = 1; i < vec.size(); i++)
  {
   for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
   {
    if (vec[i] > vec[j] && lis[j] == lis[i])
    {
     lis[i]++;
     lischain[i] = j;
     if (lis[i] > maxLen)
     {
      maxLen = lis[i];
      maxIdx = i;
     }
    }
   }
  }
  cout << ""Longest inreasing subsequence length: "" << maxLen << endl;
  cout << ""Longest increasing subsequence:"" << endl;
  deque<int> seq;
  while (maxIdx >= 0)
  {
   seq.push_front(vec[maxIdx]);
   maxIdx = lischain[maxIdx];

  for (auto item : seq)
   cout << item << "", "";

4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,5:37 the explanation at this point in the video is poorly explained.. help me understand this fundamental problem. people sit down and make these videos and do such a bad job of explaining it.

4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,You are right.  Removing +1 makes the code more efficient.  Good catch.,0
4fQJGoeW5VE,Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence,why L[i].size() < L[j].size()+1? I think should be L[i].size() < L[j].size(). at that time D[i] is not appended yet.,1
