I‚Äôve noticed some wrong point in your video.
You explained how many MST can have the differ shape as formual E C (V-1) - no.cycle
But I think this is wrong and I think it should be fixed this way.
E C (V-1) -(Number of graphs containing cycles by selecting V-1 edge on E edge)

4ZlRH0eK-qQ,3.5 Prims and Kruskals Algorithms - Greedy Method,Sir Please correct- 5:02=> No. of spanning trees = |E|C(|v|-1) - (no. of cycles). This is a wrong formula. You can't just subtract the no. of cycles. For the example which you took- No. of spanning trees would be 7C5 - (1+ 4C2) = 7C5 - 7(not 2) = 14.

Also, wouldn't the minimum costs be 3 and 5, respectively, rather than 4 and 6? They are only known to not be less than the existing ones (given the existing tree is optimal) -- there is no need for them to be at least 1 larger (even if we're restricted to integral weights).",0

4ZlRH0eK-qQ,3.5 Prims and Kruskals Algorithms - Greedy Method,"Hi Sir, I have a question. 
Why is the number of spanning trees |e|C(|v|-1) - number of cycles.
Should not it be   |e|C(|v|-1) - [ cycle1 * |number of remaining edges| C (|V|-1-number of edges in the cycle) + cycle2* |number of remaining edges| C (|V|-1-number of edges in the cycle)....]...
I hope my argument is clear, @5:07, you have mentioned |e| C (|v| -1) - number of cycles, But I feel it should not be so...
we cannt include { (2,3,4,5,6), (1,2,3,4,5), (1,3,4,5,6), (1,2,3,5,6) and not just the 2 cycles {(3,4,5), (1,2,3,5,6)}",2

I think you could have picked your words better. The reason we don't choose BE is NOT because B and E are already in the same tree (I mean, so were A and C, yet you added AC), but because adding BE would create a cycle in the tree, and MSTs aren't supposed to have cycles.",0

You then go back through the list and draw each length in turn - CE, AB, AC and AD can all be drawn; BE forms a cycle and so should be discarded. Likewise, BC and CD also form cycles and so should be discarded. DF and FG can both be drawn but FE must too be discarded because it forms a cycle. You can then work out the total length of the minimum spanning tree, which is 25. On the list, you should put a small tick by each length that has been used and a small cross by each length that has been discarded.",0

5XkK88VEILk,Kruskal&#39;s Algorithm - step by step guide,"Good tutorial....I have a question. The other MST can be created using AC before AB. So new MST will be AC - 2, BC - 1, CD - 3. This new one even seems better than the one explained in this tutorial. See the comparison here: 

Lets Call AC, BC & CD as Tree 1. And AB, BC & CD as Tree 2.

For Tree 1: Spanning from A to B = 3
                    Spanning from A to C = 2
                    Spanning from A to D = 5

For Tree 2: Spanning from A to B = 2
                    Spanning from A to C = 3
                    Spanning from A to D = 6

Can anyone help?",1
