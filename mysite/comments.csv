I would try and segment the data into different groups of people who look somewhat similar to get different kinds of faces, and then when seeing if something is a human face put it through each network and take see if any of the outputs suggest that its a human. in addition for people who look very unique, there would also need to be a network like yours that's trained on all people in general. or if you want it to just generate faces then have it randomly select a set of filters that were created using different sets of training data. from there it will create faces that are somewhat similar to the human faces in the training data set.",0

And I assure you this is evolution at play, because these cones have only appeared very recent generations (About 10)

I'm also a strong contendant to the theory that we might be devolving our pinkie toe and becoming four toed foot people due to many new generations showing their pinkie toe to be smaller then average and being less used in balance. (I use my ring toe and my big toe to balance. my pinkie is almost always off the ground or only lightly touching it. It's also curved inwards like it's trying to fuse with my ring toe.

Question is though, Attractiveness is more than a set of attractive charastics. A nose that looks attractive on one face type might appear ugly on another.  In a more generalized sense, there are things that make male faces attractive but different things that make a female face attractive. These algorithms seem to head towards a generic attractiveness: I don't think it'd produce the extremes of handsome, rugged masculine face nor an overly femme face. I'm using social stereotypes of male/female and attractiveness, but that's a different story. ;-)",0

Ryzen can actually do up to 6 instructions pr clock in corner cases on each core vs Skylakes 4.
I can get hold of some low level optimization data for Ryzen in case you're interested so you can check for yourself if its capabilities are useful for any of your projects.
After all, I assume that something as intensive as these neural networks could benefit from lower level programming languages and more low level optimizations?

I'm curious about what you'd be able to do with assembly language on a Ryzen system. =)
Also, while Cuda is neat and all, AMD actually pack more computing capabilities into their hardware so I think you can get more out of Vega once that arrives then the 1080 if you use low level programming.

And again, her hair is 4 different shades. Her nose is doing the Neo thing (What good is a mouth if you cannot speak) and her upper lip is waaay to thin compared with her lower.

#4 Looks real enough. Hair still different shades but not crazy like the ones before. But her right ear is from a different planet. And her cheekbones are misaligned.
#5 Looks like a painting again, not a photograph. Misaligned cheekbones. Her left eye is looking up where the right is looking straight.
#6 Hello huge left ear. Also, she has teeth where her upper lip would be. Her nose has been kicked hard so it's misaligned. Her right ear is cut with a scissor

Also In the video he says that it is up to the designer to determine the number of features the program scans for, how would you do that, how would you get the neural network to come up with new features that it learns are common to say for example pictures of an x or a face or whatnot?",0

because I see the size of input matrix of ReLUs is still 7*7 ( inwhile the output of pooling is 4*4 )",0

Now the question I have is about what kernels are used or how they are created/decided? I've been considering to dice up images and feed into an autoencoder and use that for kernels across the input image. Otherwise, I might create many kernels by hand or generate a random set. My other question for you and the community is what input transformations are done? With dropout, I'm not sure if destroying random pixels would help. I know that we can shift, crop, skew, warp, and rotate images. If we go this route, there are endless combinations of transformations we can do. Is there a way to avoid that? Pooling has some effect, but it can fail miserably too. And since you work for MS, when can we see CPU implementations of the CNTK algorithms? :)",0

FmpDIaiMIeA,How Convolutional Neural Networks work,Let's see whether I am getting this correctly. So basically you filter out the noise and choose a representation of the image in different bases as the pre-processing step.

I have a good math background if that helps.  (never programmed before outside of MAGMA),0
FmpDIaiMIeA,How Convolutional Neural Networks work,"This video is awesome. Your explanation are so good that I could put some ideas together 

But now I have some questions I hope you can help me.

You took a part of your image as the filter to convolve your image and get all the maps.

In some posts and books that I¬¥ve read. They say that you should use a filter to emphasize characteristics of the image,
for example, sobel kernel or sobel filter (its the same) to see edges. 
This idea comes from the investigation made from Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 of how the biological visual cortex works of 
how some neurons fired when exposed to vertical edges and some when sown horizontal or some when shown horizontal or diagonal edges.

So if I¬¥m correct I should use some filter for edge detection (sobel, canny, roberts, etc.) as my filter.
But you use a part of your image as your filter. 
Do you use it as an example, or both filter can be use?

Also you convolve the image multiple times. Do you use the same kernels every time we convolve the image or we change the kernels? (For example one time we use horizontal edge and vertical kernels, and  other time we convolve the image again we use  corner detection kernel)

As far as I know the kernel represents the weights. In regular neural networks we modified the weights. But I don¬¥t see this happens here.
do we have to change the weights?

Another question, I've seen that for color images they use a kernel 3x3x3 Are they using a 3D Sobel Kernel? I think it would be easy if we first turn the image to gray colors and use 3x3 kernels. But I don¬¥t know if it changes something.
More specific how we should treat color images at the moment of convolving the image? Should we use 3D kernels or should we convert them to grayscale first? And if we use 3D kernels the first time, they become 2D, right?

Thanks again Brandom!",1

py5byOOHZM8,Neural Network that Changes Everything - Computerphile,"Right, so you can adjust the weights with back propagation. I'm not sure if I understand how that works in detail, but I can imagine the principle. However, what concerns me is, how do you/how does the algorithm determine which combinations to make in all the intermediate layers? Mike was talking about how it might be edges, might be corners, might be brightness in the middle, we won't know, so we let the algorithm work it out, but how does it work this out?

py5byOOHZM8,Neural Network that Changes Everything - Computerphile,This approach will never lead to intelligence or understanding of the world. At the end of the day CNNs compare how many pixel in two images are equal to decide if the images are similar. Because it is unlikely that in two images of a dog many pixel are equal they have to store millions of dog pictures to be successful. Our brains use concepts - we dont care about pixel.

Observe that:
1. The goal of this video is to be able to write neural networks.  I mean, what's the point of talking about neural networks, in the first place, if we're not going to write them some day?
2. This ""back propagation' thing sounds like way more work, and way more intelligence, than the subject of the video. Why aren't we talking about that?  That sounds like a great video!
3. He realizes he doesn't know about it, panics, and shrugs it off with a distraction.  Rather than simply saying ""it's a lovely bit of code, but beyond our scope in this video"" and leaving it at that.  Or admitting that, no, he really doesn't know about it, and just takes it for granted.

How can you apply this to image processing? returning echo signals are learned via neural link storages for better results which system deems more favorable. Basically that means that your library can store node assigned info and each node instead of doing full processing theoretically can pull out saved neural link for just detecting a small portion of familiar input, run checks on that one and high-tune it to a degree when you'll need, say only 1/4th of sobel convolution etc.",0

2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"Its a great video. One question though, when we use a 3*3 filters(lets say 32) in first conv layer over 28*28 image size and produce output of 26*26. now we have 32 such 26*26 outputs. Now, each of this 26*26 is called feature map. so, we have 32 feature maps after applying 32 filters. If we apply next conv layer which has again 3*3 and 64 filters, now, we would again create 64 outputs of size 24*24. this is now 64 features. My question here is, how second layer filters would convolute over 32 feature maps(outputs) from previous layer and produce one single feature map of 24*24?",0

2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"It is interesting how long it took between the original Yann LeCun paper (1999), the foundational scientific publication on convolutional networks, and this marvelously distilled instructional video (2017). This pattern can be seen throughout science and technology: some domain expert formulates the theory in its full glory and complexity, and then someone else takes it apart and reduces it to the most basic and intuitive patterns for the instruction of novices. These two works are usually produced through very different mental labor and are rarely the work of the same person. One notable exception is Richard Feynman, whose fundamental breakthroughs in quantum physics and lectures on physics are equally lofty pinnacles of science and education, respectively. Kudos and thanks, Luis!",2
2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"The explanation of pooling is not correct, it sounded like you confused it with the activation function. Pooling does not ""find"" anything, rather it's used simply to reduce the number of features and make the network more manageable. It does this by consolidating the output from the convolution layer, either by taking the max value from each sub-section of an output volume or by taking the average of all values in the sub-section. E.g. a 4x4x1 output passed to a pooling layer with 2x2 filter and stride=2 would result in a 2x2x1 consolidated output. Of course in this simple example of a 3x3 image, pooling doesn't really come into play, but it's invaluable in mega-pixel images and networks with many layers/filters. Other than this mistake, the video was very well done, particularly the early part of building up from very simple examples.",0

2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"Thanks very much for your videos. Very lucid and elucidating. My background is in a different area, so I hope my question makes sense. If I understand correctly, because of the effect of activation functions, we are looking at a sequence of maps beginning with an n-cube, passing through more cubes of possibly different dimensions, and ending in a range space of interest, possibly discrete. ""Training"" this sequence of functions means finding local minima. Now my question: Isn't this applied Morse Theory? Seems to me that must be deep connections to neural network theory and Morse Theory. Thank you for your consideration.",0

Based on the principle of this tutorial, it seems to me that if you want to recognize a object and when the object can appear bigger or smaller in your images, you have to devise more mask? I don't know if I got myself clear. For example in the 3*3 screen, an X or O will always be that size, whilst in 1080p an X can have maybe hundreds of different sizes(not to mention there will be also rotation).

2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"At 26:24 you show the complete picture. It seems like there are too many layers. It seems the pooling layer doesn't do anything. Then the classifier layer seems redundant with the output classifier layer.. It seems like you can do everything with a single convolutional layer followed by the four character filters (fully connected). All the connections and matricies in the middle two columns seem superfluous.
For example, what does it mean to have the top X classifier matrix (third column) showing a connection to the O output logic (fourth column)?",0

2-Ol7ZB0MmU,A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition,"Hi Luis, thank you for this video!  
What I am still missing in my understanding is:
1) What does the ""inside"" look like of a trained CNN, what makes it trained or where do the ""weights"", if that is correct term get stored that make it a trained CNN
2) You've covered how the neural net does the actual identification but not the math/mechanics of how it gets trained 
3) same question but a different way of asking, how is the gradient descent implemented, ie, is it during the training phase?  
4) is part of the training that we have to feed the NN batches of images that are let's say cats vs. dogs.  That means we are essentially labeling the data correct?
5) so once the labeled data has trained the NN, what does that mean in terms of the state the NN is in to be ready to predict. 

Is the ""learned"" part represented in the ""filters"" and if not how are the filters determined?

Lastly, I see images of features that the NN has identified at different stages, how are those features rendered some of which are pretty good pictures of faces.  Is that part of the training process?

Thank you.",0

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),I was watching because I was confused on how to do backprop with convolution turns out the guy spent only 30 sec on it. which In my opinion is the most confusing topic.,0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"@42:47 In dropout, how multiplying X by (1-p), turn on and off some values, i.e make some values randomly zero or non-zero?",0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"oh, convolution isn't explained right here, (at about 14:00) it's not just matrix multiplication, you need the sum of the entries at the end, that's why the output (feature map) gets only 1 numeric value after one operation with the filter/kernel, and not a same sized matrix as the filter. also it's not just the regular matrix multiplication, it's an entry-wise one (that part is kinda clear from the background video, but was not said out loudly).",0

It will surely help me for my project",0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"I'm very happy to have stumbled on this, subbed directly! For a mathematician working with cnns for the first time, this video cut a nice bridge between detail/precision and general concept.

One thing confusing me a bit though is your mentioning of filters/feature maps as synonimous. In my humble understanding of the matter, aren't filters part of the convolution, while feature maps are the conglomerated output of the convolution, used as input for the next layer?

It might be a detail, since the input is invariant (w.r.t the learning process) and the filters are the only learnable elements of the convolution. Thus in learning the filters, you kind of automatically produce the feature maps. So it is okay to look at either one of the two, and not necessary to study both in detail. But still, they are not the same.

Please feel free to correct me if I misunderstood, I'm anxious to hone my understanding of the topic!

Kind regards",0

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"Great video! I highly respect your passion on this subject.
I have been working with neural networks for almost 8 years now.
I realized that your approach for simplicity greatly increase the interest of general public and for those who are just starting with this subject.
I salute your methodology.
Some may critic about the accuracy of the explanation, yes but it really doesn't matter for this is intended for general audience who are making sense on this world of CNN (particularly). So in the end you still have done your job and it's the job of those who wants to fully embrace this knowledge to fill those gaps.

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),Would you watch your own video @ 2x speed? Your past video sounds quite inhomogeneous..,0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"Sorry but another question:

Can we say that a CNN is basically a fully connected NN with a weight update matrix being a circulant matrix (the matrix of convolution, which is a linear operation/map), where most entries are zero (hence all neurones are not connected with the previous layer's neurones) and lot of parameters are shared (as we slide the kernel across the image)?

By ""update"" I mean, in vector notation, a_{i+1}= activation function of ( W_{i+1} a_i + b_{i+1} ), where W_{i+1} is the weight matrix connecting i-th layer to (i+1)st layer, a_{i+1} is the new input vector to be fed into (i+2)-nd later, b_{i+1} is the bias vector of the (i+1)-st layer. 

Thanks a bunch in advance!!!",0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"Hi SIraj, great video, thanks a lot! I've a question about convolving with a kernel/filter. Say you choose a set of weights in the 3*3 kernel/filter and then after taking the dot product with a 3*3 chunk of the given image, you get a negative value. How do you interpret that negative value, since the pixel values are always between 0 and 255? Do we replace that negative values by 0? 

In fact, in the link: http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/, if you choose the sharpening kernel, then you do get lot of negative values. Thanks in advance!",0
FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"@Siraj Raval, are you sure about the code for your dropout layer? If I'm reading it right then it doesn't do what you want it to do. It only scales theinput layer by a factor of 1-p, but I don't see any actual dropout behavior.

The dot product of two matrices will result in another matrix, not converge to a single number. For example, a KxN matrix dot multiplied by an NxT matrix will result in a KxT matrix where K,T,N are arbitrary natural numbers. What you're doing is called the ""Hadamard Product"" which is where you multiply element to element. You then performed a summation of all elements of the resultant matrix which gave a single value.

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"Great video, but the normalization step should be in front of pooling step right? And for the regularization part, drop out is one way of preventing over-fitting, but it is less deliberate than other regularization methods. So I think you probably should mention other method. Like what we usually see adding the weight decay in the error function, which empirically performs better and more sample independent.",0

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"Ich programmiere selbst K√ºnstliche Intelligenz bzw. Neuronale Netze. Ich will Ihren Beitrag nicht kritisieren, aber Bemerkungen m√ºssen schon angebracht sein. Bei K√ºnstlicher Intelligenz und den Neuronalen Netzen ist bisher immer das Problem, dass die Hidden-Schichten zu wenig sind, es m√ºssten in jedem Falle mehr sein, ich arbeite deshalb mit mindestens 6 HiddenSchichten, m√∂glichst noch mehr. Da kann es nat√ºrlich passieren, dass danach aus den Hiddens nichts mehr rauskommt, aber das Risiko muss man eben eingehen. Google hat ja z.B. f√ºr sdeine Hiddenschichten bei dem Spiel Go wohl insgesamt 24 Hidden-Schichten genutzt, und deshalb war das Go-Programm so erfolgreich. Wir arbeiten derzeit in der Gen-Technik an einer K√ºnstlichen Intelligenz mit Neuralen Netzen, und dabei sind auch mindestens 12-15 Hidden-Schichten erforderlich, und es klappt. Wie gesagt, wie nach dem deutschen Sprichwort Zu Vilele K√∂che Verderben Den Brei so ist es dann auch sicherlich bei den HiddenSchichten, aber 2 oder 3 Schichten ist einfacvh zu wenig und bringt letztlich falsche Ergebnisse.",0

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"what confuses me when you talk about convolutional layer is that a dot product of the matrixes with matching values will not necessarily yield a high value, because in the dot product you multiple rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second. Hence if your input matches exactly your kernel,  it won't necessarily yield a high result. As an example imagine a 3x3 matrix with 0 values and 1 in the position 2,1 (second row, first columns). Make a dot product with itself, you'll get zero.

Am I missing something? Is there a transpose that is happening to the kernel before the dot product?

P. S. I haven't watched the video to the end, but I just wanted to state the question. I will answer it myself if I figure it out by the end.

You might think that it helps beginners if you keep things simple and say that terms are ""interchangeable"".

People that are actually thinking the stuff you say through will be confused because it's not consistent and they don't know what is actually correct.

FTr3n7uBIuE,Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4),"For all of those who're wondering why to apply FFT, here's the answer (and Siraj miraculously avoided it :P)

The Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the product of the Fourier transforms of those functions. This is the convolution theorem. This result can be used to quickly compute convolutions in the Fourier domain since an element-wise product is much less computationally intensive than a convolution.

However, there is a price to be paid: the inputs need to be transformed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the product of these transformed inputs needs to be transformed again using the inverse FFT. Depending on the sizes of the inputs, these costs can be pretty significant.

np.fft.fft2 : Converts image/filter to target_dim in Fourier domain.
np.fft.ifft2 : Converts back the product from Fourier domain to real domain

Here's a very good paper (by Yann LeCun): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5851.pdf

We need to compute the convolution of each input example in a given minibatch with each filter. If there are m examples in the minibatch with k input channels, and n filters, this means we need to compute m * n * k convolutions. In the Fourier domain, this turns into m * n * k elementwise products. However, we only need to compute the FFT of each input example and each filter once. So the total number of FFTs to compute is not 2 * m * n * k, but (m + n) * k.

But that‚Äôs not everything: the output of a convolutional layer in a CNN is actually a sum of convolutions across all k input channels. Because the FFT is a linear operator, we can compute this sum in the Fourier domain, and then take the IFFT of this sum (instead of the other way around). This means we only need to compute m * n IFFTs, instead of m * n * k. It turns out that these savings can be very significant.",19

On that note, let's say you've got a conv layer with 4 filters, you run through your filters and now you've got 4 filtered images. What do you do now? Combine them and feed them forward? Feedforward all 4 images to the next layer? I get why they work, I get why they're useful.

thanks for the great video (and series)! I perceive your explanations as very clear and audience-focused. I really enjoy your videos! :)

I was wondering how exactly convolution works. You said that the convolution operation you perform is based on a dot product between the filter and a given patch of the data. I tried to simulate this process and it seems to me that to get the same results as in your excel simulation one should rather perform element-wise multiplication and then sum all the elements of the resulting matrix. How do you think about it?

YRhxdVk_sIs,Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) explained,"Nice explanation. Thanks for that. But, I have never understood how the large picture gets detected (while the image keeps shrinking with every convolved layer), Please correct my understanding - to detect a car from the input image
1. First layer, some filters (just the way you explained, say to detect edges) gets applied which detects the edges
2. On top each of the resulting image by applying each of the above filter, we apply more filters to detect any other additional features, say headlights - the image shrinks further. Effectively, we have identified the edges (car and any other object with edges in the input pic) with headlights
3. Now what? How does the resulting images get mapped to a car? How does this automatically happen? If we flatten each of the resulting image (after applying filters) into single dimension, and then should we flatten the numerous car images that we need to compare with? Its a bit impossible to get a one-to-one mapping between them. I know I am missing big, but just unable to understand end-to-end.",0

second question : is there weight to transfer from input layers to CNN layer or only the filter which will convolute the input

I like to draw a lot,and I draw  using the b√©zier tool almost exclusively,and b√©zier functions are made with polinomial equations.Furthermore,I work with b√©ziers with three ponts rather than four,so it means that all my drawing are collections of parabolas and straight lines,and I have a tendency to be picky with geometry and symmetry.With that knowledge,how could I cheat,i mean help,the CNN so that it learns to draw just like me a little bit faster,without just copying my drawings pixel-by pixel?Could I,for example,pick the first layer of neurons and already put filters for parabolas and lines?",2

ghEmQSxT6tw,Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks by Matt Zeiler,"FINALLY SOLVED: BECOMING HUMAN / INTELLIGENCE / AI. NEW COMPREHENSIVE THEORY STARTS FROM THE END by establishing the working theory of functioning of the human brain-IQ.  https://evolutionofhumanintelligence.wordpress.com/ That is the only way to solve this puzzle and here is the only picture/story that makes sense. The human evolution ( 7 million years, 30 hominins )  must perform / accomplish the evolution of intelligence (to the achievement C+IQ / collective intelligence with ability the speak ), but I have found only ""the evolution of emotions"". These three processes intersect at one point - baby / human infant that is incapable for independent survival for many years. That is not an evolutionary mistake, on the contrary, that is the key element of my research. By observing it‚Äôs mother‚Äôs behavior, a process called MSP /multi self-projection passively occurs in baby‚Äôs brain when child perceives guardians body as his own. MSP may be the most easily understood as a feeling similar to that of the apparent movement which we have when we are in a train that stands while we are looking through the window at another train that is moving. That way infant‚Äôs CNS immediately learns the shortest way to get something done, which enables the creation of many more similar thinking processes till the moment when a minimal number of thinking processes (Adam‚Äôs number) are required in order to effect of self-consciousness arise. To connect all that I have mentioned with a huge number of scientific data (Denisovans, Homo naledi, Scientific Adam, Mitochondrial Eve, autism, speech, pleasure in the presence of fire, dreams...) required membership in the Mensa organization...

What is the real purpose of using Convolution function for feature extraction? I am looking for some explanation just like for the correlation just like: ""Correlation measures the similarity between two given matrices"". I can't find any corresponding definition and explanation in Convolution. 
 Convolution is a function that is derived from the original input and a kernel. In a simple word, using convolution to modified the original image in the way that some useful features on the image will be highlighted and the redundant information will be blurred. Is that my way of explanation is correct?

JiN9p5vWHDY,Convolutional Neural Networks - Ep. 8 (Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED),Good talk(y).I think you can say that the convolution operation is just the operation of moving a scanning censor over the image to scan the image. so the censor will not see the full image at one step but it will see just one part of the image at a time the part that the censor is over on the image. By moving the censor when it reach the end of the image the censor will scan all the image and will have knowledge over the full image. The point that makes this censor powerful is that we can use a small censor which is easier to train and will find any pattern where ever it is on the image because it is moving.,1

Just wanted to ask you if you know any good references for the specifics on how to take the trained model and implement it. What I mean is once the models was trained, we get sets of filters for each of the layers and apply them to the input image. You do briefly explain how this is done, but I can not find a good tutorial that does in depth - I am rather interested in implementing the model (let's say in hardware) instead of designing or training it. For example, in layer 2, when the first pixel of each input is convoluted with its corresponding filter we then use Relu on each result or add them up first? what happens if the value is > 255? Another question is zero padding - should it be done on the inputs or outputs? Any info would help. Thank you again.",0

But, the last layer, where 36 filters get applied, how does these filters are applied to the fully connected layers? Is it just more filters get applied on these intermediate images (the output of the last convolution layer)? If yes then what is the difference?

I think in every epoch we need to go through the whole dataset. I mean in each epoch we need to feed whole the training set (50000 images) with batch size 64 or whatever to the neural neural network. However, what is basically is being done in your code is that in every epoch you are only feeding one batch to the neural network for training (this line of the code: x_batch, y_true_batch = data.train.next_batch(train_batch_size)).

HMcx-zY8JSg,TensorFlow Tutorial #02 Convolutional Neural Network,"I have some questions:

1. When you have an input with 16 channels, and you pass it on a layer with 36 channels, is the output 16x36 channels or just 36 channels? Because during the start of this viideo says that it only outputs 36 channels, while near the end, your mentioned that the output is 36x16 channels.

2. Don't we expect higher level features for deeper layers? For the first layer, you have shown that the filters somewhat resemble the actual numbers. While for the second layer, it is much more difficult to interpret. Shouldn't the second layer have more recognizable or higher level features than the first?

HMcx-zY8JSg,TensorFlow Tutorial #02 Convolutional Neural Network,"Hi! First of all I want to thank you for your high quality tutorial! I'm a newbie of TensorFlow and this kind of things really help understanding how things works. 
Also, I'm trying to skill myself by changing stuff but I'm not sure if I'm doing well. Many attempts gives ""reasonabe"" results, but other seems completely fails. Could I ask you if am I doing right? Starting from your tutorial, I just want to replace the softmax with a sigmoid. So I replace these following lines:
y_pred = tf.nn.softmax(layer_fc2) with y_pred = tf.nn.sigmoid(layer_fc2)    
and
cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=layer_fc2, labels=y_true) 
with
cross_entropy = -tf.reduce_sum(y_true_oh * tf.log(layer_fc2), reduction_indices=[1])
Where y_true_oh is the one-hot matrix of my labels.
I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but making this change I hit at best an accuracy of 15-16%. I don't know if maybe the graph that tensorflow computes isn't the one i think it is computing or if there are numerical problems...

HMcx-zY8JSg,TensorFlow Tutorial #02 Convolutional Neural Network,"I love your Tutorialvideo, because the CNN concept is so in detailed explained that it can be used for any other programming language.Awesome, Thank you!

I am trying to implement CNN in C/C++ and I have some comprehension questions about the concept and please don¬¥t be offended by my way of phrasing the questions. English is not my first language :)
 
[This goes for anyone who is willing to answer the questions :)]

HERE WE GO 

Questions:
[Q1] 
4:46 min - ""...calculate dot product of the filter and the pixels in the image below..."". 
As I remember the formular for calculating the filters with the input is: w^T * x + b; w = filter, x = inputimage and b = bias
Where do I get the values for the filter(w) values? 
Are they the same as x (in the range of 5x5) but just transposed(T) or are they randomly generated, but then in which range and why?
[Q1.1]
How does the calculation go when you have lets say 3 channels(RGB) could you give me a simple mathematical example, please? 
[Q3]
13:00 min -  It is hard to understand why the input number and input channel cannot be changed. What if we have more than one channel e.g. RGB-channels?
[Q4]
22:20 min -  ""...change the variables for all the network layers..."". Does that also mean every value in a filter? Or are the filters generated once and never be changed?

thanks again!",0

rTawFwUvnLE,Geoffrey Hinton talk &quot;What is wrong with convolutional neural nets ?&quot;,"Hinton was great... in 1988.  I don't understand what progress he has made since then his ted talk was no different. I hope Google has helped him get more up to date as he is a very bright guy. The convnet feature detector and pooling is so primitive versus a holographic excitation model we use at noonean. ""The fact that it works so well is going to make it hard to get rid of"" - thats one of the smartest things Hinton has said. these simple backprop Convnet approaches are just wrong, slow performing, and dont manage large numbers of features well. They work for what Hinton and Google did with 256x256 bit planes.  But show me all the faces in an image. show me all the triangles. nope it doesnt do that well at all. I do not think hintons approach can differentiate between a set of corners/angles and a triangle. It is very interesting that Hinton uses digits as his recognition sample which he has done now for 30 years, but other than Zero there is no notion of continuance.  I would warn people to take Hinton with a grain of salt. He is not a great cognitive scientist as he does not follow brain model to design. Holographic paradigms with active reinforcement at the neural level withing a recognition plane, with scanning across a larger image, work better than convnets or Hintons approach.  Rather than digits, I'd like to see just a solution for pure geometric shapes. Show me squares versus ovals versus triangles versus corners in a large scale photograph. Show me all the eyes vs noses vs mouths.  show me all the faces with eyes/nose/mouth in the right spatial relationship to be a face. By working with digits, Hinton is just being too simplistic. Probabilistic models may suffice in that domain. His early research on solving orientation-less recognition was quite good. But I just don't see what he's added in 30 years. At Noonean, we use a edelman-pribram holographic model as our ""capsule"" not covnets.",9
